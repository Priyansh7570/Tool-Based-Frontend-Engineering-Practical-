    <h1>Welcome to Web Development</h1>
    <p>I am driven to learn web development to combine creativity with practical
        application. This field allows me to translate abstract concepts into tangible, 
        functional websites and applications using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        There is immense satisfaction in building something from scratch that can be used
        globally.</p>
        <br>
    <p>Moreover, web development is a constantly evolving field, which means there are always
        new technologies and frameworks to learn. This continuous learning process keeps me up to date </p>
    <!-- This HTML document creates a simple "Welcome Page".

It uses CSS within a <style> block to center the main heading (<h1>) and set the paragraph text 
    color to dark gray (<p>). The body of the page contains the title "Welcome to Web Development" 
        and two paragraphs describing my motivation for learning web development, 
        demonstrating basic structure and styling. -->
