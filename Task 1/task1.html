    <h1>Welcome to Web Development</h1>
    <p>I am driven to learn web development to combine creativity with practical
        application. This field allows me to translate abstract concepts into tangible, 
        functional websites and applications using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        There is immense satisfaction in building something from scratch that can be used
        globally.</p>
        <br>
    <p>Moreover, web development is a constantly evolving field, which means there are always
        new technologies and frameworks to learn. This continuous learning process keeps me up to date </p>
